Assignment 1: EDA and Preprocessing

Overview:
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing**
to improve **data quality, reliability, and usefulness** for machine learning applications. 

It addresses key challenges such as **missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise**.

Key Steps:

1. Data Exploration – Loaded dataset, analyzed unique values, performed statistical analysis.  
2. Data Cleaning– Handled missing values, removed duplicates, detected outliers, and standardized formatting.  
3. Data Analysis– Filtered data based on conditions, visualize age vs salary, and analyze distribution by location.  
4. Data Encoding – Converted categorical variables using **One-Hot Encoding**.  
5. Feature Scaling– Normalized data using **StandardScaler** and **MinMaxScaler** for better machine learning performance.  

Usage:
Simply follow the step-by-step implementation in `EDA.ipynb` to clean, analyze, and prepare the dataset.


Assignment 2: California Housing Regression Analysis

Project Overview:

This project applies various regression techniques to predict housing prices in California using the California Housing dataset from sklearn.

Steps Covered:

1: Data Preprocessing: Load dataset, convert to Pandas DataFrame, handle missing values, and scale features using StandardScaler.
2: Train Regression Models: Implement Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVR. 
3: Model Evaluation: Assess performance using MSE, MAE, and R² Score. 
4: Comparison & Insights: Identify best and worst models and visualize results using matplotlib & seaborn.
5: Documentation & Submission: Markdown explanations included in Jupyter Notebook for clarity.

Run the Jupyter Notebook (Regression_Assignment.ipynb) for analysis.
