# **EDA and Preprocessing**

## **Overview**
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessing**
to improve **data quality, reliability, and usefulness** for machine learning applications. 

It addresses key challenges such as **missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and noise**.

## **Key Steps**

1. **Data Exploration** – Loaded dataset, analyzed unique values, performed statistical analysis.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Handled missing values, removed duplicates, detected outliers, and standardized formatting.  
3. **Data Analysis** – Filtered data based on conditions, visualize age vs salary, and analyze distribution by location.  
4. **Data Encoding** – Converted categorical variables using **Label Encoding** and **One-Hot Encoding**.  
5. **Feature Scaling** – Normalized data using **StandardScaler** and **MinMaxScaler** for better machine learning performance.  

## **Usage**
Simply follow the step-by-step implementation in `EDA_Preprocessing.ipynb` to clean, analyze, and prepare the dataset.
